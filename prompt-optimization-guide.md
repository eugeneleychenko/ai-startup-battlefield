## Judge Template (Anthropic Opus 4)

**Design Philosophy:** Professional VC Evaluation

**Key Features:**
- **Structured scoring criteria** (5 dimensions, 1-10 scale)
- **Professional VC persona** for consistent evaluation mindset
- **Explicit JSON output requirement** for system integration
- **Objective evaluation guidelines** to minimize bias
- **Clear scoring ranges** with specific guidance

**Scoring Dimensions:**
1. **Market Viability** (realistic target market assessment)
2. **Innovation** (creative and differentiated approach)
3. **Monetization Clarity** (well-defined revenue streams)
4. **TAM Accuracy** (credible market sizing methodology)
5. **Pitch Quality** (overall presentation and professionalism)

**JSON Response Format:**
```json
{
  "scores": {
    "groq": [1-10],
    "openai": [1-10], 
    "anthropic": [1-10]
  },
  "winner": "model_name",
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentence explanation"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation

```typescript
import { getPitchPrompt, getJudgePrompt } from '@/lib/prompt-templates'

// Generate pitch for specific model
const groqPrompt = getPitchPrompt('groq', {
  concept: 'Uber',
  userGroup: 'elderly people'
})

// Generate judge evaluation
const judgePrompt = getJudgePrompt({
  concept: 'Uber',
  userGroup: 'elderly people',
  pitches: {
    groq: "...",
    openai: "...",
    anthropic: "..."
  }
})
```

### API Route Integration

```typescript
// In your API routes (e.g., /api/pitch/groq/route.ts)
import { getPitchPrompt } from '@/lib/prompt-templates'

const prompt = getPitchPrompt('groq', { concept, userGroup })
const response = await streamText({
  model: groq('llama-3.3-70b-versatile'),
  prompt,
})
```

## Design Rationale Deep Dive

### Why Model-Specific Prompts?

1. **Performance Optimization:** Each model has unique strengths
2. **Output Quality:** Tailored prompts produce more compelling results
3. **Competitive Differentiation:** Highlights each model's best capabilities
4. **User Experience:** More varied and interesting pitch styles

### Word Count Considerations

- **Groq (280 words):** Optimized for speed, matches Twitter-like brevity
- **OpenAI (300 words):** Allows for more creative storytelling
- **Anthropic (300 words):** Accommodates analytical depth
- **Judge:** Longer prompt ensures comprehensive evaluation criteria

### Emoji and Formatting Strategy

- **Consistent structure** across all models for fair comparison
- **Emojis as section headers** for visual scanning and engagement
- **Bold section titles** for clear structure
- **Bullet points** where appropriate for readability

## Validation and Error Handling

The template file includes utility functions for:

- **Prompt selection** based on model type
- **Response validation** for judge outputs
- **Score normalization** to ensure valid ranges (1-10)

```typescript
// Validate judge response format
const isValid = validateJudgeResponse(response)

// Normalize scores to valid range
const normalizedScores = normalizeScores(rawScores)
```

## Performance Expectations

### Expected Characteristics by Model:

**Groq Llama 3.3:**
- Fastest generation (2-3 seconds)
- Most practical and direct pitches
- Strong on concrete numbers and implementation

**OpenAI GPT-4o:**
- Moderate speed (5-8 seconds)
- Most creative and visionary pitches
- Strong on market positioning and innovation

**Anthropic Sonnet 4:**
- Moderate speed (6-10 seconds)
- Most analytical and balanced pitches
- Strong on thorough market analysis

**Judge (Opus 4):**
- Slower but most thorough (10-15 seconds)
- Consistent scoring methodology
- Professional-grade evaluation

## Future Optimizations

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
1. **Dynamic prompt adaptation** based on concept/userGroup combination
2. **A/B testing framework** for prompt variations
3. **Performance metrics tracking** for each model
4. **Context-aware adjustments** based on previous rounds
5. **Industry-specific prompt variants** for better domain expertise

### Monitoring and Iteration:
- Track win rates by model to identify bias
- Monitor response quality and user satisfaction
- Adjust prompts based on real-world performance data
- Consider seasonal or trending topic adjustments
